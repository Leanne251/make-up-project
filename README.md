Things to do next:

Add autocomplete to the words you are allowed to search for.

- Refactor code so it's not as repetative, use objects?

Add validators to the form, so displayed inputs must have entries.

Make the items per page button work

//Setting up a data base!

- Add to basket I will need somewhere to store the data.
- then can make over the data and see on the basket.

// Finally, start looking at authorisation.
// Individuals have their own baskets.
